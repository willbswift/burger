Burger making and eating program.

This is the ReadMe file for my burger making/eating node program. It was the assignment for the 13th week at Web Developer Boot Camp.  Its called "Eat Da Burger...IN SPACE!!" and its allows the user to input the names of burgers from science fiction (or any burger really) that they'd like to eat, and then eat them.  The created burgers are saved in a Heroku database and their status as eaten or uneaten is saved as well. 

To use it one goes to the Heroku hosted site https://blooming-ravine-90697.herokuapp.com/

Once there one can type in the name of a burger they might like to eat and then hit the "Make Da Burger" button.  This will add the burger to the list of created burgers on left.

The User can look over the list of burgers and decide which one they wish to devour.  To devour a burger hit the "CONSUME MASS QUANTITIES!" button for that burger.

Once devoured the burger is transfer to the eaten list on the right side.  

The pics at the top depict some of the out-of-this-world burger that were pre-loaded into the database.
